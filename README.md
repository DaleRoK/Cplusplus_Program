# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project takes a file or list of grocery items and sorts them based on the frequency that those items were purchased. Within the program the user has 3 choices: display the items and the number of times they appear, search for a specific item and its frequency, or display a histogram of the items and the number of times they appear.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think the python coding was done particularly well. The code was kept short and concise and forced me to explore new areas of python that I had not utilized before.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think the menu or main code could have been a little more concise. I think there are much better ways to create the menu that I did. The reason I used the method I did is because it is the method I am familiar with the most. Unlike with the python code I wish I would have experimented with this a bit more than just playing it safe.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I think the most challenging part of this project was working with the given code. It wasn't part of the project but I tried to understand how the given code worked, but the method was a little over my head. I did find a very informative website, geeksforgeeks. The website was very useful for me throughout the whole class. It will definitely be a resource next to w3schools.org.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
For me it will definitely be the methodology or thought process that went in to the program. The way I approached this was much different than I had in previous projects. However, I think that may be the result of my new job that requires me to think much different than I am used to.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I kept the code concise and easy to read. I used plenty of comments and whitespace to allow for easy readability and comprehension. The code itself is relatively adaptable by using different files. The python file can easily be transferred to another program as well as the PrintMenu.cpp that I created. The reason I created the PrintMenu file was because I noticed a lot of these projects require a simple menu made and now I can just incorporate this instead of creating the code again.
